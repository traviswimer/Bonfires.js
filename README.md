# Bonfire.js

WebRTC/RTCPeerConnection signaling library to allow browser-based users to act as signaling servers for other peers.

### Currently, Bonfire only works in Google Chrome.

## Why do I need this? ##

Bonfire allows you to connect peers to other peers using existing peer connections. It won't create a peer network for you. Instead, it gives you the power to easily create your own network without having to worrying about the signaling process.
